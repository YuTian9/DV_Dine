##1. Introduction
--------
We focus on customer reviews for restaurantsï¼Œ applying topic modeling on reviews data.
**Topic model:**
* Unsupervised machine learning based on text data
* One of the most useful algorithm__LDA

##2. Prepare data
**Our datasets:**
* yelp_academic_dataset_business.json
* yelp_academic_dataset_reviews.json
** Prepare data:
* Convert json to csv:

```
#Convert a json string to a flat python dictionary which can be passed into Pandas.

import json
import pandas as pd
from glob import glob
 
def convert(x):

    ob = json.loads(x)
    for k, v in ob.items():
        if isinstance(v, list):
            ob[k] = ','.join(v)
        elif isinstance(v, dict):
            for kk, vv in v.items():
                ob['%s_%s' % (k, kk)] = vv
            del ob[k]
    return ob
 
for json_filename in glob('*.json'):
    csv_filename = '%s.csv' % json_filename[:-5]
    print 'Converting %s to %s' % (json_filename, csv_filename)
    df = pd.DataFrame([convert(line) for line in file(json_filename)])
    df.to_csv(csv_filename, encoding='utf-8', index=False)

```
* Read in R and data preprocessing:

```
# Prepare packages in R for LDA
install.packages("tm")
install.packages("topicmodels")
install.packages("ggplot2")
# Read csv in R and filter reviews for restaurants
data_bus <- read.csv("business.csv", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

# Find indices of business with "restaurant" as category
loc <- grep("R,e,s,t,a,u", data_bus$categories, perl=TRUE, value=FALSE)
data_bus_subset <- data_bus[loc,]

# Select only restaurant reviews. There are 990627 reviews.
data_review_restaurant <- subset(data_review, data_review$business_id %in% data_bus_subset$business_id &nchar(toString(text)) > 100)
cat("Number of restaurant reviews: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant))
print(dim(data_review_restaurant)[1]*9/10)

# Separate into training (90%) and testing set (10%)
index <- sample(nrow(data_review_restaurant), nrow(data_review_restaurant)*.9)
data_review_restaurant.train <- data_review_restaurant[index, ]
data_review_restaurant.test <- data_review_restaurant[-index, ]
cat("Training set: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant.train))
cat("Testing set: "); print(dim(data_review_restaurant.test))
* Key code in getting top 30 topics.
  Each topic has 10 key words. 
  Words in each topic are ordered by decreasing order by frequency.
  
```

##3. LDA
